# Introduction

webcrack is a tool for reverse engineering javascript.
It can deobfuscate, unminify, and unpack bundles, to resemble the original source code as much as possible.

- 🚀 **Performance** - Especially for large files
- 🛡️ **Safety** - Considers variable references and scope
- 🔬 **Auto-detection** - Finds code patterns without needing a config
- ✍🏻 **Readability** - Removes obfuscator/bundler artifacts
- ⌨️ **TypeScript** - All code is written in TypeScript
- 🧪 **Tests** - To make sure nothing breaks
